## Projects
---

**Contextual and Sequential Food Recommendation | Fusemachines**
- Used different Context Based Algorithm like DeepFM, FibiNet, and Sequential Based recommender like DSIN, SRGNN, NextItNet, etc 

**Landslide Detection From Remote Sensing Imagery Using Autoencoder And Attention boosted CNN**  
*GitHub: [🔗](https://github.com/)*
- Used Pretrained encoder with CNN to classify satellite images which gives 20% better accuracy than pre-trained CNN.
- Used Squeeze and excitation attention with CNN which gives 5% boost in accuracy than autoencoder with CNN.
